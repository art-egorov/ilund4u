# Example-driven guide

Here we show usage examples of the iLund4u command-line interface. Through this guide we will show you step-by-step how to use our tool in three available modes: **hotspot annotation**, **protein search**, and **proteome annotation**.
 
## Before start

### Data preparation 

The necessary sample data as well as adjustable tool configuration files are provided by iLund4u at the post-install step:    
`ilund4u --data` which copies the folder *ilund4u_data* to your working directory. 
  
**If you work on a Linux machine** after installation you should run: `ilund4u --linux`  
This command replaces the tools paths (MMseqs2) in the pre-made config files from the MacOS (default) to the Linux versions.  
If you run this command for fun and want to change it back you can use `ilund4u --mac`.


**Downloading HMM models:** ilund4u uses pyhmmer for additional functional annotation of proteins with hmmscan versus a set of databases. You can download these database from our server ([data-sharing.atkinson-lab.com/iLund4u](https://data-sharing.atkinson-lab.com/iLund4u/)) by running the following command:  
`ilund4u --get-hmms`  
List of databases: AMR: AMRFinderPlus (v. 02.05.2024.2); Anti-defence: dbAPIS_Acr (v. 19.09.2023); Defence: DefenceFinder (v. 1.2.4), CasFinder (v. 3.1.0); Virulence: VFDB (v. 10.05.2024).

^^For this demonstration we will use pharokka-generated gff files with sequences of 70 P2-like phages.  
Gff files are stored at: *ilund4u_data/guide/gff_files*.^^      
The main difference of pharokka/prokka generated gff files from a regular gff3 (for ex. which you can download from the NCBI) is that in addition to annotation rows they contain the corresponding nucleotide sequence in fasta format. 

**Note:** Each gff file should contain a corresponding nucleotide sequence. iLund4u is designed to handle pharokka/prokka produced annotation files.  


### Help messages 

To show the main iLund4u help message you can use `ilund4u --help`.  
To show mode-specific help messages use: `ilund4u --help [mode]` (e.g. `ilund4u --help hotspots`)


### Building compatible gff files based on nucleotide sequences

If your query set of sequences for hotspot annotation contains only nucleotide fasta files, below we will provide the efficient way of using [pharokka](https://pharokka.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (phage annotation pipeline) and [prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) (prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline) for preparing gff files compatible with iLund4u. 

#### Using pharokka for annotation of phage genomes

Before running pharokka you need to install pharokka databases (and pharokka itself, of course). Due to the number of non-python dependencies we recommend using a conda environment for this task. See [pharokka documentation page](https://pharokka.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/) for clear instructions.

Firstly, if you have up to ~1000 nucleotide sequences we recommend merging them into one fasta file (could be done simply by using cat: `cat folder_with_fasta_files/*.fa > merged_fasta.fa`.  
We recommend to merge multiple sequences to one file and using meta mode since in that case we do not load databases for each contig while annotating. 
  
Then, you can use pharokka in meta mode with one command:  
```sh
pharokka.py -i merged_fasta.fa  -o pharokka_output  --meta --split -t Num_of_threads \
	--skip_mash --dnaapler  -database path_do_pharokka_database 
```

Gff files for each query contig will be stored at: *pharokka_output/single_gffs*


In case you have thousands of input sequences we recommend splitting them into several fasta files with ~1000 sequences in each. Then you can run pharokka on these sets of sequences. One of the ways to parallelise this process is shown below:
```sh
for f in folder_with_fasta/*.fa; do fb=$(basename $f); nm=${fb//.fa/}; \ 
	echo pharokka.py -i $f  -o pharokka_batches/$nm  --meta --split -t Num_of_threads \
	--skip_mash --dnaapler  --database bin/pharokka/databases ; \
	done | parallel -j Num_of_parallel_processes
```
Here you set Num_of_threads・Num_of_parallel_processes equal to the number threads you want to use.

Then you can move generated gff files to one folder using:
```sh
for f in pharokka_batches/*; do mv $f/single_gffs/* pharokka_gffs/; done
```


#### Using prokka for annotation of prokaryotic genomes

Prokka does not have an equivalent of meta mode which we used in pharokka in the example above. Therefore, for any number of input sequences we prefer running prokka independently for each contig instead of dividing more complex gff files, which requires an additional step. Again, for prokka installation instruction and parameter description see  [prokka documentation page](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka).

In case your input fasta query files (^^one sequence per file^^) are located in *single_records* folders you can run:
```sh
for f in single_records/*.fa;  do fb=$(basename $f); nm=${fb//.fa/}; \ 
	echo prokka --outdir prokka/$nm --prefix $nm --quiet --cpus 1 $f ; \
	done | parallel -j num_of_available_threads
```
Then you can move generated gff files to one folder using:
```sh
for f in prokka/*; do fb=$(basename $f); echo mv  $f/$fb.gff prokka_gffs/ ; done | parallel
```

## Hotspot annotation mode

### Run with default parameters

Let's start with the main mode of iLund4u - hotspot annotation (see the workflow Figure 1).  
The only mandatory argument for this mode is a folder path containing compatible gff files.
```
ilund4u hotspots --gff ilund4u_data/guide/gff_files
```
With the first argument after ilund4u we specified the mode of usage `hotspots`.

By running this command, an output folder named ilund4u_{current_date} (e.g. ilund4u_2024_06_25-16_36) will be created.

In the example above we used 70 P2-like phages that are known to be in one community (group of related proteomes) based on our iLund4u hotspot annotation, run on all available phage sequences. As expected we find all guide sequences to be members of one community of proteomes with average proteome composition similarity (fraction of shared protein homologues) equal to 0.856 (see *proteome_communities.tsv* table and *proteome_network.gml* network files).


On the visualisation of full length sequences from the proteome community (Fig. 2) built with [LoVis4u](https://art-egorov.github.io/lovis4u/) we can see two annotated hotspots highlighted.  
The presence of hotspots in P2-like phages has previously been reported and it is known that these hotspots (highlighted in red is known as *old/tin*-encoding, while highlighted in blue as *Z/fun*-encoding) contain diverse anti-phage defence cargo proteins  *(See [Francois, et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2022.02.018); [Vassallo, et. Al, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-022-01219-4))*.  
iLund4u indicates that some genomes contain virulence factors (cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) [VF0987]) in the same hotspot locus (also were reported in  *[Francois, et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2022.02.018)))*.

On the proteome community figure (Fig. 2) you can see that most of the differences in terms of protein composition between phages are concentrated in these two hotspots. However, there are also other variable regions with at least one non-conserved protein coding gene distributed across genomes, however, iLund4u does not merge these with other hotspots due to these regions lacking conserved flanking genes or not passing the presence cutoff. Such genes are shown with in dark grey while conserved (or core) protein coding genes are light grey.

Below you can see LoVis4u visualisation of each hotspot loci - cargo proteins and up to 10 conserved flanking genes.

### Building the iLund4u database

As you can see in the workflow (Fig. 1), during hotspot annotation, iLund4u can also create a database that then can be used for two other modes: protein and proteome annotation.  
To create a database in addition to hotspot annotation you need to add the argument `-o-db <dir name>` or `--output-database <dir name>` with the specified database folder name. For example:
```sh
ilund4u hotspots --gff ilund4u_data/guide/gff_files -o P2-like_phages_guide  -o-db P2-like_phages_guide_DB
```
This database, which is built on a guide set of 70 P2-like phages annotation gff files, is also available in the ilundu4_data folder under the following path: *ilund4u_data/guide/like_phages_guide_DB*. 

### Specifying the circularity of sequences 

Another important optional argument is  `-gct, --genome-circularity-table <path>` which takes path to a table containing information for each genome about whether it is circular or not. Format: tab-separated; column names: *id*, *circular*. Values 1 or 0. For genomes in which the id is not listed in this table, the default value will be 0 (non circular) ; You can use -ncg/--non-circular-genomes to change the default value to 0 (non circular).  
This parameter is important since if the genome is circular then the first and last proteins will be considered as neighbours, which affects the flanking gene sets of proteins located near the ends of sequences. Since for these phages in the example we have circular genomes and this value is default, you can see that the breaks between the end and start of contigs are ignored for hotspot 0-0 (Fig. 3).  

**Please be aware** that if a genome is not considered circular, islands located at the ends of sequences (flanked from only one side) **will NOT be considered** in clustering to hotspots by default. This is the standard iLund4u behaviour. However, you can force to consider them by using the `-rnf, --report-not-flanked` parameter. Note that each result table (for islands, hotspots, hotspot communities, and protein groups) includes a column indicating whether the object is flanked or not.

## Protein annotation mode

### Run with default parameters

For the demonstration of protein annotation mode we took the protein [WP_171864480.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/WP_171864480.1/) , which  is annotated as E. coli RloC in the [Defense Finder database](https://defensefinder.mdmlab.fr/wiki/refseq). We chose RloC since it is an annotated cargo protein and is found on both of our annotated hotspots.  
Here we can also start with only the mandatory arguments set: `-fa <fasta_path>` - path to a fasta file with query protein amino acid sequence and `-db <db_path>` - path to iLund4u database folder. Again, optionally you can specify an output folder name using `-o <folder_name>` parameter.
```
ilund4u protein -fa  ilund4u_data/guide/RloC.fa -db ilund4u_data/guide/P2-like_phages_guide_DB -o RloC_search
```

**Note:** iLund4u searches for homology not only versus cargo proteins but against flanking genes as well.

### Specifying homology search mode and setting up labels

Protein annotation mode has three important optional arguments that we want to describe here.  

The first one: `-hsm, --homology-search-mode <group|proteins>`  which specifies the mode of search for homologous proteins in the database. If "group" is selected, a query protein is assigned to the same homologous group as that of the best search hit protein. In "proteins" mode, all target proteins that pass the cutoffs are considered to be homologues. By default, "group" mode is set. We recommend to use "proteins" mode if you want to find more diverse set of homologues.  

The second is: `-rnf, --report-not-flanked` controls whether islands and hotspots located at the ends of sequences (flanked from only one side) will be considered in search. The importance of it described in the hotspot annotation section which has exactly the same argument. 

The last one we want to highlight is `-ql, --query-label <str>` which simply changes the label of your query protein homologues on LoVis4u visualisation. For example:
```sh
ilund4u protein -fa  ilund4u_data/guide/RloC.fa -db ilund4u_data/guide/P2-like_phages_guide_DB \
	-o RloC_search -ql "RloC from the guide"
``` 
Below you can see visualisation of the same 0-0 and 0-1 hotspots with highlighted RloC proteins

## Proteome annotation mode

### Run with default parameters

For demonstration of proteome annotation mode we took *Enterobacteria phage P2* [NC_001895.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001895.1/) that is also known to be a member of the community of listed test set of phages based on our analysis of all phages (and which actually contains *old/tin* and *Z/fun*).  
In this mode mandatory arguments are `-gff <gff_path>` - path to gff file (again, pharokka/prokka annotated) of your query proteome and `-db <db_path>` - path to a database. Optionally you can specify output folder name using `-o <folder_name>` parameter.
```sh
ilund4u proteome -gff  ilund4u_data/guide/NC_001895.1.gff \
	-db ilund4u_data/guide/P2-like_phages_guide_DB -o NC_001895.1_search

### Review of visualisation types

This mode returns several types of visualisation built with LoVis4u.  
Firstly, it includes visualisation of your query proteome together with all other proteomes from a proteome community to which your query sequence was assigned.

??? card_figure "**LoVis4u visualisation of a proteome community + query sequence with hotspots highlighted** *(Figure 8)*" 
	
	![0-0_1](cmd_guide/img/lovis4u_proteome_community_hotspots.png){loading=lazy width="100%" }  

??? card_figure "**LoVis4u visualisation of a proteome community + query sequence with non-conserved proteins highlighted** *(Figure 9)*" 
	
	![0-0_1](cmd_guide/img/lovis4u_proteome_community.png){loading=lazy width="100%" }  

Additionally, iLund4u generates LoVis4u visualisation of only your query sequence highlighting annotated hotspots:

<figure markdown="span" style="align:center; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
	![qph](cmd_guide/img/lovis4u_query_proteome_hotspot.png){loading=lazy width="100%" } 
	<figcaption style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Figure 10</figcaption>
</figure>

 
Or highlighting non-conserved proteins based on a group of homologues corresponding to a protein and its presence in a community of proteomes. As you can see, non-conserved proteins that were not assigned to any hotspot are shown in more dark grey colour on the Fig. 10.


<figure markdown="span" style="align:center; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
	![qpv](cmd_guide/img/lovis4u_query_proteome_variable.png){loading=lazy width="100%" }   
	<figcaption style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Figure 11</figcaption>
</figure>

Moreover, iLund4u plots each annotated hotspots in the same way: figures containing all proteomes from a community with your query proteome and only loci of your proteome (Fig. 12, 13).


??? card_figure_red "**LoVis4u visualisation of *old-tin* hotspot (0-0) with query sequence** *(Figure 12)*" 
	
	![0-0_1](cmd_guide/img/0-0_wq.png){loading=lazy width="100%" }  

As you can see on Fig. 12, we have a hit to a Defense Finder database with a cargo protein encoded in our query sequence on the *old-tin* hotspot (as expected to *old* even though *tin* remains unannotated by pharokka and pyhmmer).


??? card_figure_blue "**LoVis4u visualisation of *Z/fun* hotspot (0-1) with query sequence** *(Figure 13)*" 

	![0-1_1](cmd_guide/img/0-1_wq.png){loading=lazy width="100%" }  

As we mentioned above, we also have LoVis4u visualisation of each hotspot with only query proteome locus. Below on Fig. 14 we show *old-tin* hotspot (0-0) locus of our query P2 phage. We see (as expected) that one out of three cargo proteins has a hit to the [OLD exonuclease](https://defensefinder.mdmlab.fr/wiki/defense-systems/old_exonuclease) of Defense Finder database. 


<figure markdown="span" style="align:center; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
	![0-1_1](cmd_guide/img/0-0_oq.png){loading=lazy width="900" }  
	<figcaption style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Figure 14</figcaption>

iLund4u has two precomputed databases of hotspots built on phage and plasmid sequences (Fig. 15).  
The database of phages was built based on running hotspot annotation mode on all available [PhageScope database](https://phagescope.deepomics.org) sequences (~870K sequences, version of September 2024). For plasmids database we took [IMG/PR database of plasmids](https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/IMG_PR/IMG_PR.home.html) (~700K sequences, version of June 2024).
